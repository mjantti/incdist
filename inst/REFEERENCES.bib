This article examines how finance impacts income inequality in India using annual time series data for over half a century. The results indicate that while financial development helps reduce income inequality, financial liberalization seems to exacerbate it. The results are robust to the use of different measures for financial development and financial liberalization.",

Even if we confine attention to OECD countries, we find people arguing that there has been a great U-turn, with inequality rising sharply after its post war fall, and others who believe that the speed of change is glacial. In order to evaluate the historical record, we need data for a long run of years. The present paper reviews evidence about covering the period 1945â€“2001 for nine OECD countries. It is widely believed that rising inequality is attributable to technological change and to globalisation. The second part of the paper argues that these are only part of a complex story. Household incomes depend on public policy and on sources of income apart from work. What is happening at the top of the distribution may need to be explained quite differently.",

@Report{atkinson1999wider,
  abstract     = "This lecture addresses one of the most important economic issues facing our societies and the world as a whole: rising income inequality. There is a widely held belief that rising inequality is inevitable. Increased inequality is the result of forces, such as technological change, over which we have no control, or the globalization of world trade, which people believe, despite historical evidence to the contrary, to be irreversible. Kuznets (1955) suggested that income inequality might be expected to follow an inverse-U shape, first rising with industrialization and then declining. Today, the Kuznets curve is commonly believed to have doubled back on itself: the period of falling inequality has been succeeded by a reversal of the trend. Seen in this way, the third quarter of the twentieth century was a Golden Age not just for growth and employment, but also for its achievement in lowering economic inequality. On this basis, the marked rise in wage and income inequality observed in the United States and the United Kingdom in recent decades will unavoidably be followed by rises in other countries, and indeed world-wide. Policy can make little difference. In this lecture, I take issue with the assertion that rising inequality is inevitable. It may in fact turn out that the twenty-first century sees rising inequality, but this is not inescapable. We do have some choice. In challenging the popular position, I focus on the experience of OECD countries, since it is these that I know best, but what is happening in industrialized economies cannot be divorced from what is happening in developing countries. Indeed, one frequently expressed view is that increased wage dispersion in the OECD countries is due to increased competition from low-wage economies. This is a view which it seems particularly appropriate to examine in the WIDER Annual Lecture. (I have discussed the rival view that increased wage dispersion is due to technological change in Atkinson (2000)).",

@Book{atkinsonandbourgiugnon2000,
  abstract     = "Distributional issues may not have always been among the main concerns of the economic profession. Today, in the beginning of the 2000s, the position is different. During the last quarter of a century, economic growth proved to be unsteady and rather slow on average. The situation of those at the bottom ceased to improve regularly as in the preceding fast growth and full-employment period. Europe has seen prolonged unemployment and there has been widening wage dispersion in a number of OECD countries. Rising affluence in rich countries coexists, in a number of such countries, with the persistence of poverty. As a consequence, it is difficult nowadays to think of an issue ranking high in the public economic debate without some strong explicit distributive implications. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxes, monetary or trade union, privatisation, price and competition regulation, the future of the Welfare State are all issues which are now often perceived as conflictual because of their strong redistributive content. Economists have responded quickly to the renewed general interest in distribution, and the contents of this Handbook are very different from those which would have been included had it been written ten or twenty years ago. It has now become common to have income distribution variables playing a pivotal role in economic models. The recent interest in the relationship between growth and distribution is a good example of this. The surge of political economy in the contemporary literature is also a route by which distribution is coming to re-occupy the place it deserves. Within economics itself, the development of models of imperfect information and informational asymmetries have not only provided a means of resolving the puzzle as to why identical workers get paid different amounts, but have also caused reconsideration of the efficiency of market outcomes. These models indicate that there may not necessarily be an efficiency/equity trade-off; it may be possible to make progress on both fronts. The introduction and subsequent 14 chapters of this Handbook cover in detail all these new developments, insisting at the same time on how they tie with the previous literature on income distribution. The overall perspective is intentionally broad. As with landscapes, adopting various points of view on a given issue may often be the only way of perceiving its essence or reality. Accordingly, income distribution issues in the various chapters of this volume are considered under their theoretical or their empirical side, under a normative or a positive angle, in connection with redistribution policy, in a micro or macro-economic context, in different institutional settings, at various point of space, in a historical or contemporaneous perspective. Specialized readers will go directly to the chapter dealing with the issue or using the approach they are interested in. For them, this Handbook will be a clear and sure reference. To more patient readers who will go through various chapters of this volume, this Handbook should provide the multi-faceted view that seems necessary for a deep understanding of most issues in the field of distribution.",

@Article{autorkatzandkearney2006,
  abstract     = "Much research (surveyed in Katz and Autor, 1999) documents a substantial widening of the U.S. wage structure since the late 1970s, driven by increases in educational wage differentials and residual wage inequality. The growth in wage inequality was most rapid during the 1980s, and involved a spreading out of the entire wage distribution. Rapid secular growth in the demand for skills, partly from skill-biased technical change (SBTC), combined with a slowdown in the growth of the relative supply of college workers helps explain these wage changes. Eroding labor market institutions-the minimum wage and unions-further contribÂ­ uted to rising wage inequality. Recent work emphasizes a slowing of wage inequality growth over the last 15 years (David Card and John DiNardo, 2002; Thomas LeÂ­ mieux, forthcoming). This {"}revisionist{"} literaÂ­ture views the 1980s surge in wage inequality as an {"}episodic{"} event caused by institutional forces and argues that {"}modest{"} inequality growth in the 1990s is inconsistent with a key role for SBTC. We reconsider this revisionist view, focusing on a marked change in the evolution of the U.S. wage structure over the past 15 years and diÂ­vergent trends in upper- and lower-tail wage inequality. We first document that wage inequality in the top half of the distribution has exhibited an unchecked secular rise for 25 years, but it has ceased growing since the late 1980s (and for some measures narrowed) in the bottom half of the distribution. We next demonstrate that employment growth differed sharply in the 1990s versus the 1980s, with more rapid growth of employment in jobs at the bottom and top relative to the middle of the skill distribuÂ­tion. Borrowing terminology from Maarten Goos and Alan Manning (2003), we characterize this pattern as a {"}polarization{"} of the U.S. labor market, with employment polarizing into highÂ­ wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of midÂ­ dle-skill jobs. We then show how a model of computerization in which computers compleÂ­ment nonroutine cognitive tasks, substitute for routine tasks, and have little impact on nonrouÂ­ tine manual tasks, can rationalize this polarization pattern.",

My analysis questions this favor, suggesting the profile heterogeneity model provides a more consistent representation of the data. I also provide new estimates of the variation in earnings growth rates. Previous evidence is from relatively unrepresentative samples. Individuals one standard deviation above the mean enjoy a 20\%-30\% earnings advantage in just 10 years.",

  abstract     = "Developing and transition economies are prone to financial crises, including balance of payments and banking crises. These crises affect poverty and the distribution of income through a variety of channels: slowdowns in economic activity, relative price changes, and fiscal retrenchment, among others. This paper deals with the impact of financial crises on the incidence of poverty and income distribution, and discusses policy options that can be considered by governments in the aftermath of crises. Empirical evidence based on both macro- and microlevel data, shows that financial crises are associated with an increase in poverty and, in some cases, income inequality. The provision of targeted safety nets and the protection of specific social programs from fiscal retrenchment remain the main short-term propoor policy responses to financial crises.",

The analysis shows that inequality in wealth and income can be positively or negatively related to the optimal tax rate. In either environment, higher inequality leads to a lower after-tax return to capital, thereby reducing the economy's growth rate.",

Such redistributive policies entail distortions to labor supply and savings, but also serve as partial substitutes for missing credit and insurance markets. The resulting tradeoffs for growth and efficiency are explored, both theoretically and quantitatively, in a model that yields complete analytical solutions. Progressive education finance always leads to higher income growth than taxes and transfers, but at the cost of lower insurance. Overall efficiency is assessed using a new measure that properly reflects aggregate resources and idiosyncratic risks but, unlike a standard social welfare function, does not reward equality per se. Simulations using empirical parameter estimates show that the efficiency costs and benefits of redistribution are generally of the same order of magnitude, resulting in plausible values for the optimal rates. Aggregate income and aggregate welfare provide only crude lower and upper bounds around the true efficiency tradeoff.",

Agents interact through local public goods or externalities (school funding, neighborhood effects) and economy-wide linkages (complementary skills, knowledge spillovers). Sorting families into homogeneous communities often minimizes the costs of existing heterogeneity, but mixing reduces heterogeneity faster. Integration therefore tends to slow down growth in the short run yet raise it in the long run. A move to state funding of education presents society with a similar intertemporal trade-off. Local and global complementaries play major roles in determining the efficient social and educational structures.",

  abstract     = "Using two unifying models and an empirical exercise, this paper presents and extends the main theories linking income distribution and growth, as well as the relevant empirical evidence. The first model integrates the political-economy and imperfect-capital-market theories. It allows for explicit departures from perfect democracy and embodies the tradeoff between the growth costs and benefits of redistribution through taxes, land reform, or public schooling: such policies simultaneously depress saving incentives and ameliorate the wealth constraints which impede investment by the poor. The second model is a growth version of the prisoner's dilemma which captures the essence of theories where sociopolitical conflict reduces the security of property rights, thereby discouraging accumulation. The economy's growth rate is shown to be a decreasing function of interest groups' rent-seeking abilities, as well as of the gap between rich and poor. It is not income inequality per se that matters, however, but inequality in the relative distribution of earning and political power. For each of the three channels of political economy, capital markets, and social conflict, the empirical evidence is surveyed and discussed in conjunction with the theoretical analysis. Finally, the possibility of multiple steady states leads the author to raise and take up a new empirical issue: are cross-country differences in inequality permanent, or gradually narrowing? Equivalently, is there convergence not only in first moments (GDP per capita), but in distribution?",

Significant polarization arises from minor differences in endowments, preferences or access to capital markets.

  abstract     = "Inclusive growth is widely embraced as the central economic goal for developing countries, but the concept is not well defined in the development economics literature. Since the early 1990s, the focus has been primarily on pro-poor growth, with the â€œpoorâ€� being people living on less than one dollar a day, or in some regions two dollars a day. The idea of pro-poor growth emerged in the early 1990s as a counterpoint to a concern with growth alone (measured in per-capita income) and is generally defined as growth which benefits the poor as much or more than the rest of the population. Examples include conditional cash transfers, which target the poor while minimizing the fiscal burden on the public sector, and donorsâ€™ emphasizing primary over higher education as an assured way to benefit the poor while investing in long-term growth through increases in human capital. Yet these pro-poor, inclusive policies are not necessarily without tradeoffs in fostering long-run growth. In this paper I argue that the concept of inclusive growth should go beyond the traditional emphasis on the poor (and the rest) and take into account changes in the size and economic command of the group conventionally defined as neither poor nor rich, i.e., the middle class.",

  note         = "Many of the countries that have recently converted to a market-based economic system have also experienced an alarming increase in income inequality â€” a widening gap between the haves and have nots. But to what extent is the increase in inequality also increasing the opportunities for economic advancement â€” particularly for those at the bottom of the economic ladder? Does the creation of greater opportunities make a region's move to the market politically acceptable? And, if opportunities don't increase along with inequality, will it eventually cause a political backlash against a country's market policies? This book highlights the importance of finding the answers to those questions by examining the issues of social mobility and opportunity as an essential part of the income inequality puzzle. It provides a summary of the latest research on the economics and politics of social mobility in both developed and emerging market economies, including the conceptual issues involved and the challenges of accurately documenting trends. The book concludes with a discussion of the economics of opportunity and mobility in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and the politics and perceptions of mobility in the two regions.

  abstract     = "A method based on higher moments is presented in this paper by which the type of a univariate Pearson frequency distribution (population) can be determined and its parameters estimated from truncated samples with known points of truncation and an unknown number of missing observations. Estimating equations applicable to the four-parameter distributions involve the first six moments of a doubly truncated sample or the first five moments of a singly truncated sample. When the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced, there is a corresponding reduction in the order of the sample moments required. A sample is described as singly or doubly truncated according to whether one or both {"}tails{"} are missing. Estimates obtained by the method of this paper enjoy the property of being consistent and they are relatively simple to calculate in practice. They should be satisfactory for (a) rough estimation, (b) graduation, and (c) first approximations on which to base iterations to maximum likelihood estimates. Previous investigations of truncated univariate distributions include studies of truncated normal distributions by Pearson and Lee [1], [2], Fisher [3], Stevens [4], Cochran [5], Ipsen [6], Hald [7], and this writer [8], [9]. In addition, the truncated binomial distribution has been studied by Finney [10], and the truncated Type III distribution by this writer [11].",

The inequality of each of these dimensions shows a different pattern over time. To make an overall assessment of the evolution of well-being inequality, I make use of a recently devel- oped multidimensional inequality index which reflects the implicit value judgments of the revised Human Development Index. Multidimensional well-being inequality has decreased over the considered period. However, this result is shown to depend crucially on the weighting scheme selected, the aggregation procedure and the transformation of the income dimension.",

Applications to bombing accuracy studies and to life testing are pointed out. As regards bombing accuracy the parameter estimated is the reciprocal of the variance in a normal bivariate distribution having circular symmetry. The reciprocal is estimated because there is no maximum likelihood estimator of the variance and any estimator of the variance is badly biased (see Section 2). Results of a synthetic sampling experiment are given to provide information on rapidity of convergence of the distributions of the estimators to their asymptotic distributions.",

  abstract     = "Abstract: In this note we analyze international income polarization by using several well-behaved polarization indexes and the data provided by an updated version of the well-known Penn World Tables. The empirical evidence suggests that polarization follows a curvilinear pattern, with initial growth followed by decline, in clear contrast to the pattern of monotonous growth found by Seshanna and Decornez [Seshanna, S. and Decornez, S. (2003). Income polarization and inequality across countries: An empirical study. Journal of Policy Modeling, 25, 335â€“358]. The exclusion of China and India from the analysis also fails to provide results that are consistent with a continued growth in polarization. Inequality also shows the same temporal pattern. These results seem to reinforce the non-pessimistic views about the effects from globalization to international income distribution.

To pay for them, they spend more than they earn and carry record levels of debt. In a book that explores the very meaning of happiness and prosperity in America today, Robert Frank explains how increased concentrations of income and wealth at the top of the economic pyramid have set off {"}expenditure cascades{"} that raise the cost of achieving many basic goals for the middle class. Writing in lively prose for a general audience, Frank employs up-to-date economic data and examples drawn from everyday life to shed light on reigning models of consumer behavior. He also suggests reforms that could mitigate the costs of inequality. 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT2Falling Behind 1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT2compels us to rethink how and why we live our economic lives the way we do.",

  abstract     = "This paper describes the evolution of inequality in the world economy since 1963 and describes the relationship between inequality, development, political regimes and the functional distribution of income. The movement of inequality within-countries since 1971 exhibits a strong common pattern across countries, suggesting that changes in the between-sector terms of trade and world interest rates exerted a powerful influence; thus, commodity prices and the global effects of monetary policy appear critical to changing inequality worldwide. We also find that political regimes matter: egalitarian regime types exhibit lower measures of inequality, after controlling for economic variables, region and changes over time.",

  abstract     = "The U.S. wage structure evolved across the last century: narrowing from 1910 to 1950, fairly stable in the 1950s and 1960s, widening rapidly during the 1980s, and â€œpolarizingâ€� since the late 1980s. We document the spectacular rise of U.S. wage inequality after 1980 and place recent changes into a century-long historical perspective to understand the sources of change. The majority of the increase in wage inequality since 1980 can be accounted for by rising educational wage differentials, just as a substantial part of the decrease in wage inequality in the earlier era can be accounted for by decreasing educational wage differentials. <br><br>Although skill-biased technological change has generated rapid growth in the relative demand for more-educated workers for at least the past century, increases in the supply of skills, from rising educational attainment of the U.S. work force, more than kept pace for most of the twentieth century. Since 1980, however, a sharp decline in skill supply growth driven by a slowdown in the rise of educational attainment of successive U.S. born cohorts has been a major factor in the surge in educational wage differentials. Polarization set in during the late 1980s with employment shifts into high- and low-wage jobs at the expense of the middle leading to rapidly rising upper tail wage inequality but modestly falling lower tail wage inequality.",

This is not entirely consistent with the idea of skill-biased technical change as a hypothesis about the impact of technology on the labor market. We argue that the {"}routinization{"} hypothesis recently proposed by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) is a better explanation of job polarization, though other factors may also be important. We show that job polarization can explain one-third of the rise in the log(50/10) wage differential and one-half of the rise in the log(90/50).",

  abstract     = "We investigate the forces affecting the distribution of income by analyzing an unbalanced panel of information for 16 industrialized countries for the years 1966 through 1994. Income inequality is measured with the Gini coefficient of equivalent disposable income; individuals are the unit of analysis; the statistical analysis uses panel methods. The results suggest that many factors affect the development of income inequality. Some factors are strictly economic: A decreased industrial sector generally fosters inequality, and some support is found for the view that increased trade of manufactured goods from developing countries is also a factor. Other forces are outside a strictly defined market sphere: Low inequality is found when a large proportion of the labor force belongs to a trade union and also when there is a large public sector. In addition, demographic circumstances are important, since the proportion of the population under age 15 has a positive effect on inequality. We find, however, no association between the unemployment rate and inequality.",

If $r = \lbrack qn \rbrack, 0 < q < 1$, it is shown under mild regularity conditions, for the case of one parameter, that estimation of $\theta$ by maximum likelihood is best in the sense that $\hat{\theta}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$, is (a) consistent, (b) asymptotically normally distributed, (c) of minimum variance for large samples. A general expression for the variance of the asymptotic distribution of $\hat{\theta}$ is obtained and small sample estimation is considered for some special choices of frequency function. Results for two or more parameters and their proofs are indicated and a possible extension of these results to more general truncation is suggested.",

  abstract     = "This article studies the relationship between household income and housework time across 33 countries. In most countries, low-income individuals do more housework than their high-income counterparts; the differences are even greater for womenâ€™s domestic work time. The analysis shows that the difference between rich and poor womenâ€™s housework time falls with economic development and rises with overall economic inequality. I use a cross-national reinterpretation of arguments from the historical time-use literature to show that this is attributable to the association between economic development and the diffusion of household technologies and to the association between economic inequality and the prevalence of service consumption among high-income households. Results for a direct measure of technology diffusion provide striking evidence for the first interpretation. The findings question the widespread notion that domestic technologies have had little or no impact on womenâ€™s housework time. On a general level, I find that gender inequalities are fundamentally conditioned by economic inequalities. A full understanding of the division of housework requires social scientists to go beyond couple-level dynamics and situate households and individuals within the broader social and economic structure.",

This review provides an overview of research evaluating inequality in income and wages in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989. The empirical studies agree that inequality has increased, but disagree about the amount, pace, source, and explanation of change. Patterns of inequality are unrelated to economic performance, to the pace or timing of reform, or to rates of subsequent growth. Inequality increased the most in the least successful countries and the least in those countries with historic cultural connections to the West. Inequalities by age, education, region of the country, and health status increased; differences by gender appear to have declined. Although data are plentiful and promising, it is not yet possible to conclude that patterns of inequality among postcommunist countries are due to the genesis of capitalism, to social and cultural assimilation to the West, to adaptations of redistributive institutions to deal with poverty and unemployment, or to globalization.",

The authors combine a pooled time-series data base on welfare state effort and its determinants assembled by Huber, Ragin, and Stephens (1997) with data on income distribution assembled in the Luxembourg Income Survey (LIS) archive. In the case of the LIS data, the authors recalculate the microdata in order to remove the distorting influence of pensioners on pretax, pretransfer income distribution. They examine the determinants of two dependent variables: pretax, pretransfer income inequality and the proportional reduction in inequality from pre- to post-tax and transfer inequality. They test hypotheses derived from power resources theory against alternatives derived from the literature on the development of the welfare state and the determinants of income inequality. The results offer strong support for power resources theory, particularly in the case of reduction in inequality. Union density, unemployment, and percentage of female-headed households were the main determinants of pre-tax and transfer inequality ( ${\rm R}^{2}$ = .64), while leftist government, directly and indirectly through its influence on the size of the welfare state, was found to be by far the strongest determinant of distribution ( ${\rm R}^{2}$ = .81).",

The authors build on models consisting of sociological and economic variables, adding the strength of the democratic tradition, long-term legislative partisan political power distribution, and social spending to explain variation in inequality. They analyze an unbalanced pooled time series data set for income distribution in 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries from 1970 to 2000. They show that the political variables add explanatory power. A strong record of democracy and a left-leaning legislative partisan balance are associated with lower levels of inequality, as are social security and welfare spending under democratic regimes. Thus, they replicate some and modify other well-established findings from studies of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in the very different context of Latin America and the Caribbean. They confirm that the partisan composition of government matters, and show that, in contrast to OECD countries, where social security and welfare spending consistently reduce inequality, such spending reduces inequality only in a democratic context in Latin America and the Caribbean.",

Inequality increased in Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States but did not increase in Canada and the Netherlands. Increased inequality of household head's earnings and increased shares of spouse's earnings in family income account for much of the observed increases in income inequality. The public sector can, in general, be assigned a moderating effect on these changes. Demographic shifts are not assigned any major role in inequality changes.",

  abstract     = "Using the Chinese Urban Household Survey data between 1997 and 2006, we find that income inequality has a negative (positive) effect on household consumption net of education expenditures (savings) even after we control for household income. We argue that people save to improve their social status when social status is associated with pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits. Rising income inequality can strengthen the incentives of status-seeking savings by increasing the benefit of improving status, and by enlarging the wealth level required for status upgrading. We also find that the negative effect of income inequality on consumption is stronger for poorer and younger people and that income inequality stimulates more education investment, which are consistent with the status-seeking hypothesis.",

The framework emphasizes the role of supply and demand factors and the interaction of market forces and labor market institutions. Recent changes in the US wage structure are analyzed in detail to highlight crucial measurement issues that arise in studying wage structure changes and to illustrate the operation of the supply-demand-institution framework. The roles of skill-biased technological change, globalization forces, changes in demographics and relative skill supplies, industry labor rents, unions, and the minimum wage in the evolution of the US wage structure are examined. Recent wage structure changes are placed in a longer-term historical perspective, and differences and similarities in wage structure changes among OECD nations are assessed.",

  abstract     = "We use data from the Luxembourg Income Study to examine household market inequality, redistribution, and the relationship between market inequality and redistribution in affluent OECD countries in the 1980s and 1990s. We observe sizeable increases in market household inequality in most countries. This development appears to have been driven largely, though not exclusively, by changes in employment: in countries with better employment performance, low-earning households benefited relative to high-earning ones; in nations with poor employment performance, low-earning households fared worse. In contrast to widespread rhetoric about the decline of the welfare state, redistribution increased in most countries during this period, as existing social-welfare programs compensated for the rise in market inequality. They did so in proportion to the degree of increase in inequality, producing a very strong positive association between changes in market inequality and changes in redistribution. We discuss the relevance of median-voter theory and power resources theory for understanding differences across countries and changes over time in the extent of compensatory redistribution.",

  abstract     = "Wage inequality has increased dramatically in the United States since the 1980s. This article investigates the relationship between this trend and occupational structure measured at the three-digit level. Using the Current Population Survey from 1983 to 2002, we find that the direct association between occupations and wage inequality declined over this period as within-occupational inequality grew faster than between-occupational inequality. We estimate multilevel growth models using detailed occupational categories as the unit of analysis to assess how the characteristics of occupations affect changes in mean wages and levels of wage inequality across this time period. The results indicate that changes in mean wages across occupations vary depending on the characteristics of individuals in those occupations and that intra-occupational inequality is difficult to predict using conventional labor force data. These findings seem largely inconsistent with the common sociological view of occupation as the most fundamental feature of the labor market. Correspondingly, a more comprehensive approach-one that incorporates the effects of organizational variables and market processes on rising wage inequality in the New Economy-is warranted.",

  abstract     = "Using a large administrative data set, this paper studies the evolution of the East German wage structure throughout the transition period 1992-2001. Wage dispersion has generally been rising. The increase occurred predominantly in the lower part of the wage distribution for women and in the upper part for men. Sectoral transition affected women to a much larger extent than men. A sequential decomposition analysis using quantile regressions reveals that changes in industry-specific remuneration schemes contributed strongly to the rise in wage inequality in the lower part of the distribution for female workers. On the other hand, inter-industry trends away from the manufacturing sector towards service sectors contribute to the smaller increase of inequality in the upper part of the distribution, while causing wage dispersion in the lower part of the distribution to decline. Changes in the industry composition alone would have led to a polarization of wages for female workers.! For men, changes in individual characteristics and a general time trend contribute the largest part to the increasing wage dispersion. These gender differences result from employment segregation across industries right after German reunification, and a particularly strong concentration of females in the public sector.",

This article analyzes the political implications of the emergence of the Chinese middle class and discusses how the Chinese Communist Party copes with the rising middle class. This article concludes that at present, the Chinese middle class quietly endorses the leadership in Beijing. Nevertheless, as economic growth continues, the middle class will not only grow in size but also may change its political attitude. Following the footpaths of its counterparts in the West and other Asian countries, the Chinese middle class may develop not only post-material lifestyle and values, but also play an important role in the struggle for democracy.",

The findings are that higher income causally generates good health and that this effect is of a similar magnitude as when traditional estimation techniques are used.

We explain how this is bad for democracy, the economy, and the aggregate health of the nation. We examine the governmental policies and interventions that increased the middle class following the depression and maintained its vigor through the post-World War II period. The impetus for these changes in governmental policies in the 1930s was to end the Great Depression. We pose the question of whether a nation can recover from a depression without invigorating the middle class. We conclude that in order to recover from the current economic and financial crisis, the middle class must be strengthened.",

In contrast to the last twenty years and the â€œgilded ageâ€� that preceded it, from the time of the first New Deal through the 1970s, the middle class prospered. Wealth and income were more equitably shared in America. This article examines policies that strengthened the middle class during the New Deal, during World War II, and after World War II. These policies strengthened the bargaining power of labor. This article offers suggestions for reviving the middle class now with particular focus on empowering labor.",

Alternative functional forms for comparable estimation techniques can then be contrasted and estimation techniques for a given functional form can be compared.

Much of the neighbor correlation is explicable in terms of the large earnings differential between urban and nonurban areas combined with the strength with which urbanicity of childhood neighborhood predicts urbanicity of adult location. This pattern is subject to a variety of interpretations, but it is quite different from the usual view of neighborhood effects.",

  abstract     = "This study proposes using correlations between neighboring children in their later socioeconomic status to bound the proportion of inequality in socioeconomic outcomes that can be attributed to disparities in neighborhood background. We apply this approach to educational attainment data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which has sampled neighboring children and followed them into adulthood. We find that, once the effects of a few readily observed family background characteristics are accounted for, the correlation between neighboring children in their eventual educational attainment is only about 0.1. Given that even this figure is inflated by neighbors' similarity in unmeasured aspects of family background, the results suggest a limited role for neighborhood factors in accounting for inequality in educational attainment.",

Thus general conclusions of few differences by sex in patterns of intergenerational occupational mobility are premature. In this study, five possible sex-differentiated patterns of intergenerational mobility are proposed and evaluated. The five patterns alternately suggest that the four intergenerational relationships between the occupations of sons and daughters and their fathers and mothers (i) differ by sex of the parent, (ii) differ by sex of the offspring, (iii) differ by the match or contrast between the sexes of the parents and offspring, (iv) are all different, or (v) are all the same. Results of an analysis based on data from the Canadian National Mobility Study indicate that, although the relationships between occupational origins and destinations are, to a large degree, equivalent, there are consistent (and readily interpretable) sex-differentiated linkages between the occupations of parents and their offspring.",

Partitioning mobility into relative (circulation) mobility and mean (structural) mobility reconciles some of the contrary predictions. Analysis of the Occupational Changes in a Generation Study data confirms that the relationship between total mobility and fertility is weak and not always significant. However, when total mobility is partitioned into relative mobility and mean mobility, the results suggest that fertility behavior is consistently negatively related to mean mobility and positively related to relative mobility.",

In this paper, we use an approach that incorporates two unique aspects of women's occupational experiences. First, we consider housework to be a possible occupational outcome for women. Second, we consider the occupations of mothers as well as those of fathers in the portrayal of women's occupational origins. We show that this approach more fully displays the influences of occupational origins on women's subsequent occupational activities. In particular, we find that women whose mothers worked are themselves more likely to join the labor force, and their occupations are likely to resemble their mother's.",

It is shown that if the amount of information supplied by truncated samples of individual observations of a certain size is less than that supplied by censored samples of individual observations of the same size, then the same is true in the case of truncated and complete samples of grouped observations. This result has been used to show, in the case of normal populations, that the BAN (best asymptotically normal) estimates of the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$ based on truncated samples of grouped observations of a certain size are, in general, jointly less efficient than those based on complete samples of grouped observations of the same size.",

The estimation criteria used are minimum chi-square and multinomial maximum likelihood. In evaluating the theoretical probabilities corresponding to the intervals, use is made of the inversion theorem for characteristic functions. Chi-square tail probabilities for independent samples are pooled by means of theKolmogorov statistic. As an illustration, the methods are applied to Dutch and Australian income data.",

  abstract     = "Distributional issues may not have always been among the main concerns of the economic profession. Today, in the beginning of the 2000s, the position is different. During the last quarter of a century, economic growth proved to be unsteady and rather slow on average. The situation of those at the bottom ceased to improve regularly as in the preceding fast growth and full-employment period. Europe has seen prolonged unemployment and there has been widening wage dispersion in a number of OECD countries. Rising affluence in rich countries coexists, in a number of such countries, with the persistence of poverty. As a consequence, it is difficult nowadays to think of an issue ranking high in the public economic debate without some strong explicit distributive implications. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxes, monetary or trade union, privatisation, price and competition regulation, the future of the Welfare State are all issues which are now often perceived as conflictual because of their strong redistributive content. Economists have responded quickly to the renewed general interest in distribution, and the contents of this Handbook are very different from those which would have been included had it been written ten or twenty years ago. It has now become common to have income distribution variables playing a pivotal role in economic models. The recent interest in the relationship between growth and distribution is a good example of this. The surge of political economy in the contemporary literature is also a route by which distribution is coming to re-occupy the place it deserves. Within economics itself, the development of models of imperfect information and informational asymmetries have not only provided a means of resolving the puzzle as to why identical workers get paid different amounts, but have also caused reconsideration of the efficiency of market outcomes. These models indicate that there may not necessarily be an efficiency/equity trade-off; it may be possible to make progress on both fronts. The introduction and subsequent 14 chapters of this Handbook cover in detail all these new developments, insisting at the same time on how they tie with the previous literature on income distribution. The overall perspective is intentionally broad. As with landscapes, adopting various points of view on a given issue may often be the only way of perceiving its essence or reality. Accordingly, income distribution issues in the various chapters of this volume are considered under their theoretical or their empirical side, under a normative or a positive angle, in connection with redistribution policy, in a micro or macro-economic context, in different institutional settings, at various point of space, in a historical or contemporaneous perspective. Specialized readers will go directly to the chapter dealing with the issue or using the approach they are interested in. For them, this Handbook will be a clear and sure reference. To more patient readers who will go through various chapters of this volume, this Handbook should provide the multi-faceted view that seems necessary for a deep understanding of most issues in the field of distribution.",

The model provides corrected parameter estimates and standard errors, as well as estimates of the intragroup correlation at both levels. The model is estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We apply the model to an analysis of the covariates of child survival using survey data from northeast Brazil collected via a hierarchically clustered sampling scheme. We find that family and community frailty effects are fairly small in magnitude but are of importance because they alter the results in a systematic pattern.",

title={The Effect of Income and Wealth on Subjective Well-Being in the Context of Different Welfare State Regimes},
journal={Journal of Happiness Studies},
year={2020},
month={Feb},
day={01},
xabstract={In this article, we study the causal effects of two economic standing measures on the subjective well-being of the elderly, as well as the moderating effects of distinct welfare regimes on these relationships. For our analysis, we classify countries into the following welfare regimes: Conservative, Social-democratic, Mediterranean, and Post-socialist. We address the income endogeneity issue by utilizing the panel structure of our data and instrumenting for income. Our findings show that the significance and strength of the effects of both economic standing measures on life satisfaction are moderated by the institutional context or welfare regime type, which we support by providing several robustness checks. Finally, we make a deeper inquiry into the heterogeneity of the countries classified. After controlling for endogeneity, our results indicate that the relationship between economic standing and life satisfaction is mostly driven by individual countries, which suggests caution when studying the effect of economic standing on subjective well-being.},

xabstract={During the past decades, life expectancy has continued to increase in most high-income countries. Previous research suggests that improvements in life expectancy have primarily been driven by advances at the upper end of the health distribution, while parts of the population have lagged behind. Using data from the entire Swedish population, this study aims to examine the life expectancy development among subgroups of individuals with a history of common diseases relative to that of the general population.},
